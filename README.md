# SVG-Logo-Maker

## Description

My goal for this project was to create a fast and easy logo generator. It allows an individual to, with just a few quick questions, generate a rough mockup for a logo that they may use for their own projects, saving time for the user in the long run.  While working on this project I learned how to format and utilize jest to test different outcomes of the code in order to make sure they are functioning properly.
